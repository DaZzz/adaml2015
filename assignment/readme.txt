## Files description

- animation1.m - The effect of first N principle components. For that perpose
  the first level is utilized.

- animation2.m - The effect of Nth principle component. For that perpose the
  first level is utilized.

- animation3.m - Temperature changes of the filtered temperature map, where
  highest peaks were removed.

- correlation.m - Demonstration of the correlation between real data and random
  projection.

- spectra.m - Spectra filtering process. Filtering is utilized in
  full_data_processing, animation3.m, temperature_changes.m.

- temperature_changes.m - Temperature changes of a single point from the
  subset before and afterfiltering. Subset is extracted from level 1.

- full_data_processing - % Plots that are showing trends in temperature
  changes utilizing information of the whole data set. Data is processed  using
  random projection.
